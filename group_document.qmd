## Micro report

### Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
#library(cowplot)
```

It seems cowplot is not installed in the web server

### Look at the data in PC coordinates 1

```{r}
biopsy <- read_csv("https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv")
```

```{r}
pca_fit <- biopsy |> 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% # retain only numeric columns
  prcomp(scale = TRUE) # do PCA on scaled data
```

```{r}
pca_fit |> 
  augment(biopsy) |> #add original dataset back in
  ggplot(aes(.fittedPC1, .fittedPC2, color = outcome)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c(malignant = "#D55E00", benign = "#0072B2")
  ) 
```

Removed theme_half_open and background_grid due to an error

### Look at the data in PC coordinates 2

```{r}
pca_fit |> 
  tidy(matrix = "rotation")
```

Define arrow style for plotting

```{r}
arrow_style <- arrow(
  angle = 20, ends = "first", type = "closed", length = grid::unit(8, "pt")
)
```

Plot rotation matrix

```{r}
pca_fit |> 
  tidy(matrix = "rotation") |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "PC", names_prefix = "PC", values_from = "value") |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2)) +
  geom_segment(xend = 0, yend = 0, arrow = arrow_style) +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = column),
    hjust = 1, nudge_x = -0.02, 
    color = "#904C2F"
  ) +
  xlim(-1.25, .5) + ylim(-.5, 1) +
  coord_fixed()# fix aspect ratio to 1:1
```

Removed "theme_minimal_grid(12) because of an error

### Look at the variance explained by each PC

Looking at the variance explained by each PC using eigenvalues

```{r}
pca_fit |> 
  tidy(matrix = "eigenvalues")
```

And as a plot:

```{r}
pca_fit |> 
  tidy(matrix = "eigenvalues") |> 
  ggplot(aes(PC, percent)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#56B4E9", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent_format(),
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.01))
  )
```

Again removing the the theme due to an error

-   **T1:** Find the `GitHub` repository for the `ggplot2` R-package

-   **Q1:** How many Contributors are there?

    295

-   **T1:** Find the `GitHub` repository for the `Linux kernel`

-   **Q2:** How many Contributors are there?

    5000+

-   **Q3:** Discuss in your group why having an organised approach to version control is central? And consider the simple contrast of the challenges you were facing when doing the course assignments.

This matters because, first of all, files are organised and reproducible and, second, you can go back and regenerate a former version if anything goes wrong. This would have been nice for collaborating, so that everyone shares the same final document.

-   **Q4:** Discuss in your group, what happened and why? Try copying the message and paste it into google, did you get any hits?

R doesn't have our GitHub credentials and we should use the access token instead of the password

-   **Q4:** Again, find the `ggplot` GitHub site and see if you can find how many branches there are?

### New analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
x <- seq(1,9)
y <- seq(9,1)

ggplot(  mapping = aes(x=x,
                       y=y))+
  geom_point(size = 1) 
  labs(title = "Beautiful scatterplot")
  theme_minimal()
```
